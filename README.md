Tweaks to preserve bandwidth on Windows 10 by blocking Windows telemetry

Windows 10 sends a lot of data to Microsoft. I am on a limited bandwidth connection so it's necessary for me to trim as much network usage as possible.

The initial file is a list of hosts to add to the HOSTS file in C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\ but I will be working on a script to make changes in the future.
